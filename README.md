# Exploratory Data Analysis For Portfolio Optimisation
This project aims at building an optimal portfolio using analysis from historical data

## What is Portfolio Optimisation
Portfolio Optimisation is the process of selecting the best asset distribution across a selection of assets from the range of other options, according to an objective. This objective typically maximizes factors such as expected return, and minimizes costs like financial risk. 

This project is based on the principle that investors should want the highest return for the lowest risk. To achieve this, assets in a portfolio should be selected after considering how they perform relative to each other, i.e., they should have a low correlation.

Optimisation is necessary for clients and investors looking towards maximizing the risk-return-trade-off since this process is targeted at maximizing the return for every additional unit of risk taken in the portfolio.
